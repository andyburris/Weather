This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license;
the app is also available on Google Play.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, that this app does not collect any personally identifiable
information. All data created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply
erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

This app does send information, specifically your device's location (only if you grant the location
permission), to the Apple WeatherKit service to obtain relevant information. This is optional, and
is not required for the application to work. The app itself does not store this data.
